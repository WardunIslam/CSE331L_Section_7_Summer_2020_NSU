The Process by which memory can be allocated to variables during the run time is called Dynamic Memory Allocation. 
So, Dynamic memory allocation is the process of assigning the memory space during the execution time or the run time.
When we do not know how much amount of memory would be needed for the program. We have to use dynamic allocation.
The dynamic array is the array which are allocated memory at the runtime.
We don't have to set the size of the array at compile time. 
Dynamic array is the flexible because when we need to more element in array we can extend our array at runtime, 
we can easily add or remove items from array.
